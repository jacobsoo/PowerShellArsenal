PowerShellArsenal
====================

Overview
--------
This is a side project porting my existing Forensics and Malware analysis tools to PowerShell.
The project is a port of an old project lying in one of my HDD.
Finally got time to pick up PowerShell and clean up some parts of the code.

Currently the number of scripts are limited as of 12th October 2015:

Ideally i will be able to port most of my scripts so that it can be used to perform malware analysis and other Forensics stuff.
